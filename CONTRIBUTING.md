# PokÃ©Radar Contribution Guide

##For developers

To get started, clone the git repository into any directory on your machine. Then run these commands:

- `npm install` to install all the node dependencies.
- `npm run build` to build the application from the source.

At this point the application should be built and ready to use.

> Before running it, you'd need to get your own [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) Key for the app to function properly. Once you've gotten the API Key set the environment variable `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to whatever your key is.

After you've done the above steps, you can now run the app with the following commands:

- `npm run serve-app` to launch the server at `http://localhost:32598`. 
- `npm run serve-client` to launch the client at `http://localhost:32600`. 

Happy coding!
