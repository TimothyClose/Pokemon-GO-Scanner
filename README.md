# PokéRadar

Application that scans nearby locations of Pokémon, Pokéstops, Gyms etc. for Pokémon GO. 

---

### Roadmap (still WIP):

- Add Web application so it's easier to supply application parameters (username, password, location etc.).
- Add map view to see Pokémon, Pokéstops and Gyms around the targeted location.

### Thanks to:

- [Armax's](https://github.com/Armax) project [Poké.io](https://github.com/Armax/Pokemon-GO-node-api), which is the core of my project. I copied over most of the functionality to clean, organize, and port to Typescript for ease of extension.
- [tejado](https://github.com/tejado) for the [Pokemon GO API library / demo](https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi).
- [AHAAAAAAA](https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/) for providing his [proof of conept](https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map/).
