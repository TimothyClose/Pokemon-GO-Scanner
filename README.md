# Pokemon GO Scanner

Application that scans nearby locations for Pokemon.

---

### Roadmap (still WIP):

- Add Web application to provide application parameters.
- Add map view to see Pokemon around the targeted location.

### Thanks to:

Heavily inspired by [Armax's](https://github.com/Armax) project [Poke.io](https://github.com/Armax/Pokemon-GO-node-api), which has been ported into Typescript and extended to include more functionality.
