# PokéRadar

Application that scans nearby locations of Pokémon, Pokéstops, Gyms etc. for Pokémon GO. 

---

### Roadmap (still WIP):

- Add Web application so it's easier to supply application parameters (username, password, location etc.).
- Add map view to see Pokémon, Pokéstops and Gyms around the targeted location.

### Thanks to:

Heavily inspired by [Armax's](https://github.com/Armax) project [Poké.io](https://github.com/Armax/Pokemon-GO-node-api), which I cleaned, organized, and ported to Typescript to be extended to include more functionality.
